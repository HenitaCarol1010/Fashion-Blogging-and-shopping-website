                     <p>Sunglasses are a real character builder. Or at least they play a large roll in the character that you play to others. They’re front and center and they can literally change the shape of your face. So before you buy your next pair of shades, think about what you might be saying to the world.

                     <p>
                        Among other celebrities with Birkins to burn, Kim Kardashian has been chastised for using one as a gym bag, ditto Kate Moss – as a nappy bag. In 2012, a $100,000 (£63,675) crocodile-skin Birkin was reportedly set on fire (then bisected by chainsaw) by Francesca Eastwood, daughter of Clint, in a so-called art project conceived by her photographer boyfriend, Tyler Shields – an act that reportedly led to death threats. (When the smoke had cleared, it was claimed the bag was, in fact, imitation. Even more heinous.)

                     </a>
                     <p>
                        What are the chances that you are reading this in anything but jeans or a pair of tailored trousers? We’d place our bets on it. So the next time you find yourself gravitating towards buying another one of your beloved sweats, make sure to pick one that’s outdoor appropriate. Made sharp with a blazer, paired with a satin camisole or with a crisp white tee tucked in, there’s plenty of ways to make your waistline-forgiving pants an edge when stepping out.

It’s not too late to hop on the tie-dye trend yet—find proof in Deepika Padukone, Hailey Bieber and Ananya Panday still pulling out noteworthy joggers from their closets. Choose from Kanika Goyal’s candy-hued pair or Collina Strada’s jogger that’s easier on the environment. For the soft, feel-good version of a cargo pant with utilitarian details, go for Jaywalking, Essé or Lee Mathews. Tempted to bring back velour? You don’t need to think twice—Asos has plenty of wide-legged numbers to choose from. The ultimate going-out track pant would be Gucci’s silver lamé number (as seen on Malaika Arora), which can literally brighten up any room. For safer but equally impactful party numbers, look to Versace, AK-OK by Anamika Khanna, Zara or Palm Angels.

                        Selena Gomez Shares the Story Behind Her Enchanting Music Video, ‘De Una Vez’</h3>
                     <p>With today’s release of her first Spanish language single in nearly a decade, ‘De Una Vez,’ Selena Gomez is sharing a new side of herself. The song’s title roughly translates to “at once,” and within the lyrics, Gomez delves into themes that are all too relatable. Heartache and spiritual growth have always made for great songs, and the tale told through ‘De Una Vez’ has resonance no matter what language you speak. “[It’s] such a beautiful song and I think it has a very powerful meaning behind it for anyone who has had their heart broken,” says Gomez. “We all have the pain and the scars from various experiences we go through in life, but it’s really how we heal ourselves. Not only is it about leaving the past behind and forgiveness, but more importantly, it’s also about strength, moving forward, and starting your next chapter.”</p>
