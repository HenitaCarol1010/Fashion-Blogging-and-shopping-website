                     <h1>Anne Hathaway’s Couture-Filled Instagram Posts Are the Glamour We Need Right Now</h1>
                     <p>
                        If your 2021 lacks glamour, head over to Anne Hathaway’s Instagram. The actress’s latest film, Locked Down, hits HBO Max today, and, in lieu of a premiere or whirlwind international press tour, Hathaway has been serving looks on social media. In the past 24 hours, the star has shared three dazzling metallic gowns, and there’s no telling what she might post next
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <blockquote>
                        Next up, a liquid metal corseted creation by Vivienne Westwood. A throwback to Westwood’s spring/summer 2012 collection, the sultry piece has become a favorite of celebrities thanks to its body-conscious silhouette that accentuates hourglass proportions. The dress’s plunging neckline and daring hemline would command attention on their own, but paired with diamond drop earrings and plenty of blingy rings, the look was impossible to ignore
                     </blockquote>
                     <br>
                     <p> Hathway kicked things off with a gold number from Azzaro. The long-sleeved piece was a standout when it first appeared on the runway back in January of last year. But Hathaway and stylist Erin Walsh took things up a notch, complimenting the layers of lamé with oversized earrings and a deep burgundy lip. The striking effect was heightened by a dramatic pose that showed off the gilded pleats as Hathaway twirled.

                     <h2> Takes a Page From Bella’s Closet With This Jacket!</h2>
                     <p>Today, Gigi Hadid was spotted out in New York City in a head-turning look. The model posed by a truck to promote Zayn’s newest album Nobody Is Listening. The new mom opted for a graphic yellow T-shirt plastered with the cartoons, a pair of high-waisted faded jeans with tears at the knees, and sturdy brown hiking boots. Another bright touch for a pop of contrast? A thin red and blue striped belt.

                        Though, there was something that gave us sartorial déjà vu and seemed to take a page from her sister Bella Hadid’s style playbook. She wore a checked, oversized blazer that had a dollar bill stitched onto the pocket by the label 3.Paradis. Her sister Bella has sported a dark blue incarnation of the jacket in the past, wearing the piece with a pair of midriff floss pants back in March. Let’s keep an eye out for what looks the two trade next.

                     <p>
                        If your New Year Eve felt anticlimactic at best and utterly depressing at worst, you weren’t alone. What’s the meaning of a new calendar when so little has changed? Six months ago, we were sure 2021 would be different. Surely we’d be prepping for Fashion Week by now. Unfortunately, that’s still a big no for most of us.</p>

This is the second time Harris, 56, has been through a dragged-out contest; when she ran for attorney general of California in 2010, the race was so close that ballot counting went on for more than three weeks. (On election night that year, her opponent had declared victory, too.) On the chilly, sunny morning of November 7, Harris started the day by power walking with her husband, entertainment lawyer Douglas Emhoff.

                        <p>
                           As temperatures grew colder in Moscow this past November, Vogue Russia’s executive fashion director Sveta Vashenyak began her hunt for a fur jacket. Vashenyak had been searching for an already worn fur coat, but each vintage coat had something stylistically wrong with it. “They all had these huge sleeves and big shoulders,” she says over Zoom. “And in Russia, we have these huge buttons.” Eventually, she found a long, light brown mink coat from a vintage fur specialty store outside of Moscow. She brought it to the tailor and had it altered. Gone was the “ugly collar and huge shoulders,” and then what was once considered a babushka coat now looked like something more from The Row. After receiving compliments from friends, Vashenyak decided to launch Nereja in December, a label in which she gives dated fur coats a new, chic life.

But if you're looking for an exercise that'll leave you feeling better and balanced after, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Whether you like to go all-out or slow it all the way down, there's a stress-busting workout that'll find your favour.

                           Radhika Apte has always kept it real, and she doubles down on this philosophy through her Instagram photos. “Beauty should be about being happy and natural, rather than being posed and pretentious. Our relationship with it has evolved. It’s no longer about conceding to a stereotype but a celebration of one’s self. Beauty, however we choose to define it, belongs to us,” she shared with Vogue India. Ahead, we round up ten of the best makeup, skincare and wellness tips that she's shared with her fans on Instagram.
