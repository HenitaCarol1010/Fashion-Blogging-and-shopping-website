                        In the 21st century the style trends of the fashion industry dominate the world more than they ever did, and control not only the way people dress but also trends in home ware design, makeup fashion and people’s overall attitudes. In the 60s flower power did not only mean flares and tunics, it summed up the whole attitude of a generation, and this is even more prominent today.

                        In times like today, fashion is bold and daring, and this reflects a noughties generation that is not afraid to say what they think, or wear what they want. Fashion is not just a means of clothing your body, it is the essence of your personality and beliefs, and designers are well aware of the power they hold. Designers’ predictions and designs for the coming season are more hotly anticipated than any other revelation in the world.

A period of time portrayed in a picture can be identified immediately just by the style of clothes the people are wearing, and this sums up just how powerful and all-encompassing fashion is.

                     <p>
                        The trend for "vintage" clothing as fashion exploded in the 1960s. Prior to this, the trading and wearing of old clothing had different connotations. All levels of trade in old clothing were well supported by the increasing speed of fashion change from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the growth in consumer availability of these trends. As the commercial constituency for fashion increased, the growth in trade of old clothing was incremental as the quantity of these goods increased.

                     </a>
                     <p>Blue Monday typically takes place on the third Monday in January and it’s known as the saddest day of the year. It’s a time when people can feel their emotions dipping: the festive season is over; many have long, dark winter nights to contend with; some are struggling with debt; and others are struggling to stick to their New Year’s resolutions.Many argue that Blue Monday doesn’t really exist, though—and they’re probably right. In fact, the date was calculated in 2004 by a psychologist for a travel company that wanted to sell more holidays during winter. Blue Monday or not, there’s no denying that this year is a little harder than normal. The pandemic is still a reality, with many around the world going in and out of lockdowns. If you’re feeling low or sad, here are some simple strategies you can use to cope and bounce back.</p>

                     <p>Coco Chanel was more than in sync with her times, she defined them. Independent and active, she designed clothes that rejected the idea of decorative womanhood. Chanel had places to go, people to meet, things to do, and hearts to break—and fashion was just one of her passions. The designer collaborated with the Ballets Russes, was romantically entangled with the poet Pierre Reverdy, and supported artists throughout her life.</p>
